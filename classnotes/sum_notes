**Slide 11 - Array Basics**
- Arrays in C have a fixed size defined by constants.
- Variables cannot be used to determine array sizes.
- Initialization with a constant is valid (`float sal[SIZE];`), but using a variable is not (`float sal[size];`).

**Slide 13 - Array Indexing**
- Indexing and access in arrays are similar to Python.
- Index must be an integer or expression of integers (`arr[3]`, `arr[2*j]`, `arr[i++]`).

**Slide 23 - Array Initialization**
- Arrays are initially filled with garbage values.
- Distinction between static and global variables.

**Slide 25 - Default Values**
- Uninitialized elements in an array are set to default value 0.
- Initialization syntax: `data_type array_name[array_size] = {value1, value2, ... valueN};`

**Slide 33 - Searching in 1-D Array and Bubble Sort**
- Array searching methods include Linear Search and Binary Search.
- Bubble Sort algorithm explained (L to R, compare and swap).

**Slide 40 - Arrays, Functions, and Library Functions**
- Array element access: `arr[i][j]` for a 2D array.
- Functions defined, called, and basic syntax provided.
- Explanation of library functions and user-defined functions.

**Function Definition and Call Practices**
- Return statement convention: `return (expression);`.
- Arguments and parameters should match in number and type.
- Ignored arguments and garbage values discussed.

**Static Variables and Const Keyword**
- Static variables restrict scope and persist until program termination.
- Const keyword ensures variable immutability.

**Memory Segments in C**
- Overview of memory segments: Text, Data, BSS, Stack, Heap, Shared.
- Global and static variables' initialization behavior.

**Formatting and Input Considerations**
- Formatting using `%w.ns` and `% -w.ns`.
- `scanf()` without `&` reads entire arrays, considers spaces as delimiters.
- Solution: scanset for input.

**Pointers in C**
- Pointers store memory addresses in C.
- Pointer syntax: `datatype *pointer_variable;` or `datatype* pointer_variable;`.
- Arrays and pointers relation: `arr` is same as `&arr[0]` (applicable to strings).

**Validity in Addressof (`&`)**
- Validity examples: `&j` (variable), `&arr[1]` (array element).
- Invalid examples: `&289` (constant), `&(10+11)` (expression).

**Memory Overview and Pointer Usage**
- Text, Data, BSS, Stack, Heap, Shared memory segments.
- Pointers' efficiency and error prevention emphasized.
- Memory cells shared among different programs in the 'Shared' segment.
