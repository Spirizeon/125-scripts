// SLIDE-11
#define SIZE 10 // constant

// we can't use variables for size of arrays

int size = 15;
float sal[SIZE];  // valid
float sal[size]; // invalid

// SLIDE-13
// Indexing and access is same as python
// Index shall be an integer or expression of integers

// arr[3], arr[2*j], arr[i++]

// Initially array has GARBAGE values
// Difference between static and global variables

// SLIDE-25
// If some elements are not initialised
// they have default value 0

// data_type array_name[array_size] = {value1,value2,...valueN};

// Searching in a 1-D Array 
// + Linear Search
// + Binary Search

// Bubble sort
// + L-->R
// + Compare two elements
// + Push greater element to right
// + Keep cycling until no swaps are needed

// SLIDE-40
// arr[i][j] is array_name[row_num][col_num]
// Functions
// block of code that can be repeated
// if only one function then it's main()

// Functions can be stored in library

// Two types:
// + user-defined
// + library function

// Library functions (special)
// Predefined by the compiler designer
// Declared in the header files
// body stored in .dll (dynamic link layer) files 

// Three parts of user-def functions
// + function definition 

int funcname(){
	printf("hi world")
}

// + function call
funcname()

// NOTE: No spaces in function name


// data_type function_name(type1 arg1,type2 arg2,...,typeN argN){
// 	function_body;
// }


// when no arguments, write func_name(void) #good practice
return (expression) needs to be in brackets for convention
return 1 //not good
return (1) // good

too many values beyond number of parameters
func(inta,int b, int c){
	...
}

main(){
	func(5,6,7,8);
}

the fourth argument is simply ignored

main(){
	func(5,6);
}

c receives a garbage value

0 in return 0 for successful execution
non-zero in return N for interruption

the main() function is a hybrid function
+ function declared by the C compiler itself
+ function definition by the programmer
+ function call by the operating system 

Library functions
supplied with every C compiler
source code of library function are not given to the user (they are in compiled form)
they are stored in files called dll (dynamic linking library)
the user gets only the object code

Definition is precompiled and present in libarry
declaration in header files (files with .h extension)
function call by the programmer

Static variable
---
in local variables, the memory is wiped off
in global variables, the memory is visible to all functions

Static variables keep it restricted to local scope
and keep the memory intact until the end of the execution
static statement is only viewed ONCE (VERY IMPORTANT)

Const 
---
once it is mentioned, it cannot be changed.

Global variables are automatically initialised to 0 at time of declaration (same case for static)

but local variabless will have garbage values
%w.ns
w memory spaces will be made
n spaces will be considered
%-w.ns
means left-aligned

scanf() without & will read the entire array
considers <space> as a default delimiter

solution: scanset
why pointers:
code with pointers more efficient than code without
ugly errors:
error here, showing problem there (nightmarish)
more on memory:
[[Text(code)],
[data],
[BSS],
[Stack],
[Heap],
[Shared]]

+ text/code tells how much is already compiled
+ data contains all initialised global variables (and initialised static)
+ BSS contains all non-initialised global variables (non-initialised static)
+ stack contains all local variables
+ heap contains dynamically allocated memory
+ shared will have the same memory cells shared among different programs

Validity in addressof(&):
&j // valid used with variable
&arr[1] // valid used with array element
&289 //invalid used with a constant
&(10+11) //invalid used with an expression

array is a sequence of addresses
arr is same as &arr[0] (it points to the start of the array)
(NOTE: only in strings)

pointers:
variables that store memory address
+ size of each pointer is 4 (each address is an integer)
+ has a name
+ "points" to a particulat location in memory
`datatype *pointer_variable`;
`datatype* pointer_variable`;


*foo = &bar;
foo = 69;
pf(foo):$ 69;
