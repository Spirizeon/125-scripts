%w.ns
w memory spaces will be made
n spaces will be considered
%-w.ns
means left-aligned

scanf() without & will read the entire array
considers <space> as a default delimiter

solution: scanset
%[A-Z,a-z] // these are allowed
%[^@] // everything is allowed except @:w

entire scanset syntax is regex

two strings cannot be copied
two strings cannot be compared

enter <string.h>
copy two strings => strcpy(s1,s2)
join two strings => strcat(s1,s2)
join two strings upto a particular characters => strcat(s1,s2,n)
returns lenght without void character => strlen(s1)
return 0/1 when comparing values of strings index by index
nOTE: it stops when a value mismatch is encountered // 
first length is checked
returns difference (negative if first is smaller)

strchr(s1,ch) is a character finder function (returns pointer to occurence)jjA
