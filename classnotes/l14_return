return (expression) needs to be in brackets for convention
return 1 //not good
return (1) // good

too many values beyond number of parameters
func(inta,int b, int c){
	...
}

main(){
	func(5,6,7,8);
}

the fourth argument is simply ignored

main(){
	func(5,6);
}

c receives a garbage value

0 in return 0 for successful execution
non-zero in return N for interruption

the main() function is a hybrid function
+ function declared by the C compiler itself
+ function definition by the programmer
+ function call by the operating system 

Library functions
supplied with every C compiler
source code of library function are not given to the user (they are in compiled form)
they are stored in files called dll (dynamic linking library)
the user gets only the object code

Definition is precompiled and present in libarry
declaration in header files (files with .h extension)
function call by the programmer

Static variable
---
in local variables, the memory is wiped off
in global variables, the memory is visible to all functions

Static variables keep it restricted to local scope
and keep the memory intact until the end of the execution
static statement is only viewed ONCE (VERY IMPORTANT)

Const 
---
once it is mentioned, it cannot be changed.

Global variables are automatically initialised to 0 at time of declaration (same case for static)

but local variabless will have garbage values
